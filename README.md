# Robo Portfolio Advisor

The **Robo Portfolio Advisor** is a Python-based application that generates optimized stock portfolios, developed for the 2024 CFM 101 Team Competition. The challenge was to create a portfolio-generation algorithm capable of adapting to unknown stock baskets, showcasing skills in finance, computer science, and problem-solving.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Stock Analysis**: Adapts to stock lists with no prior knowledge.
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Balances returns and risk effectively.
- **Resilient Design**: Handles market uncertainties and unpredictable scenarios.

## Challenges and Success
This project addressed dynamic stock selection and uncertainty with innovative and robust solutions. Despite curveballs in stock lists, it delivered high-performing portfolios, highlighting strategic planning and technical expertise.
