    "The overall strategy exhibited by the portfolio is based on that of momentum investing, in which stocks which have increased in value over a recent period are invested in.

Despite its inherent risk, the strategy is frequently used by existing algorithmic trading models. \n",

First, the beta of the stock, which measures volatility relative to the market, is retrieved, as well as the stock's standard deviation. Sharpe Ratio, a comparison of return relative to risk, is also calculated. For calculating Sharpe ratio, risk-free returns were estimated at 4%; this was based on the benchmark yield of a 10-year Canadian government bond, which as of November 2024 was around 3.3%. The 4% figure was used to prioritize stocks with high expected returns.\n",

    "A few strict requirements are imposed on stocks in order for them to be considered for the final portfolio. First, tickers with a beta value below 1 were eliminated, in order to eliminate low-volatility stocks that might not align with the goal of maximizing returns. Second, tickers with a negative Sharpe ratio are removed, effectively eliminating any stock with an expected return below 4%. This ensures that all selected stocks trend upwards and exhibit positive momentum. \n",
    "\n",
    "For stocks which meet these requirements, Beta, standard deviation, and Sharpe ratio are all weighed at 40%, 20%, and 40% respectively and summed up to provide an overall rating for each stock. To achieve this, all three properties are standardized relative to the rest of the stocks in portfolio in order to provide for a balanced rating."

    "One last variable is introduced in order to create a final rating. Market capitalization, the total value of a company's outstanding shares on the stock market, is standardized to be in the range of 0 to 1 and weighted at 30% of the final rating (thereby reducing the actual weights of the previous variables). Generally, higher market-cap companies enjoy greater financial security and are less speculative in nature, making their historical performance a more reliable metric. This factor was introduced in order to add a measure of stability to the portfolio without sacrificing significant profitability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although it may seem precarious or incomprehensive to base each stock's rating on only four criteria, the strength of the formula is ultimately derived from its simplicity. By focusing on a few critical metrics rather than overfitting the model with too many variables, the formula ensures that weight is only given to impactful factors and statistical noise is averted. \n",
    "\n",
    "After each stock has been given its final rating, its weight in the portolfio is based on the proportion of its rating to the combined rating of the top twelve stocks, although the final weight also takes into account the upper and lower limits on the proportion of each stock in the portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision to only include the top twelve stocks wasn't taken lightly. However, prioritizing concentration over diversification was necessary in order to ensure that the porfolio's capital was allocated solely to high-potential investments. Although diversified portfolios experience less risk, gains are often diluted by low-performing stocks. This occurence was observable in assignment 3, in which the inclusion of sectors outside of the tech industry (which is known for high risk and growth potential) greatly reduced the overall returns of a portfolio. The benefits of concetrated portfolios have been emphasized by renowned investors such as Warren Buffet, who explained his rationale with the following analogy: \"If you have Lebron James on your team, don't take him out of the game just to make room for someone else… It's crazy to put money into your 20th choice rather than your first choice.\" Transaction fees are also lowered, although this benefit is more marginal."
